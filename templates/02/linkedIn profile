I am a software developer passionate about developing software that can operate at scale. I am a big advocate for simplicity - I believe unnecessary complexity and pre-mature optimization are most often the root of other evils in software. 

I  am particularly interested in distributed computing, event-driven systems and optimization. While I am excited about how software is changing the world for end users, the thing that excites me most are the innovations that happen within software engineering.
